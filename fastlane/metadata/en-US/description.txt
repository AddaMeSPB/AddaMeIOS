ADDA, a new way location-based network to meet new people and know more about them.  With real-time events, hangouts, and communication. You can post what you want to do, nearby so people can see: Grabbing a taxi, selling, buying, events around you, hangouts, or helping out those near you are some examples.​ We believe with this app you can meet people in real life much easier. Our goal is to let people connect in real life as opposed to just connecting on your screen.

Meeting new neighbors​ is easier than ever.
